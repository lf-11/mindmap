You are an expert in document structure analysis. I am analyzing an English document and have a problem with headline hierarchy detection.

The structure of headline layers in this document is as follows:
{% for layer_num in layer_range -%}
{% set layer_info = all_layers[layer_num] -%}
{% if layer_num == 1 -%}
The first headline layer is {{ layer_info.name }} ({{ layer_info.numerals }}).
{% elif layer_num == 2 -%}
The second layer is {{ layer_info.name }} ({{ layer_info.numerals }}).
{% elif layer_num == 3 -%}
The third layer is {{ layer_info.name }} ({{ layer_info.numerals }}).
{% elif layer_num == 4 -%}
The fourth layer is {{ layer_info.name }} ({{ layer_info.numerals }}).
{% elif layer_num == 5 -%}
The fifth layer is {{ layer_info.name }} ({{ layer_info.numerals }}).
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

The problem is at this section: The previous header is correctly identified as layer {{ previous_layer }} ({{ previous_layer_numerals }}), but then followed by {% if problematic_headers|length == 1 -%}
a header of layer {{ current_layer }}: {{ problematic_headers[0].text }}
{%- else -%}
headers of layer {{ current_layer }}: {{ problematic_headers | map(attribute='text') | join(', ') }}
{%- endif %}.

{% if expected_layers_info|length > 0 -%}
{% if expected_layers_info|length == 1 -%}
{% set expected = expected_layers_info[0] -%}
Expected would be layer {{ expected.layer_num }} ({{ expected.layer_name }}: {{ expected.layer_numerals }}).
{% else -%}
Expected would be layers {% for exp in expected_layers_info -%}
{{ exp.layer_num }} ({{ exp.layer_name }}: {{ exp.layer_numerals }})
{%- if not loop.last %} and {% endif -%}
{%- endfor %}.
{% endif -%}
{% endif %}

The relevant text section spans from line {{ section_text.start_line }} to line {{ section_text.end_line }}.
Start headline: '{{ section_text.start_headline }}'
End headline: '{{ section_text.end_headline }}'

Please analyze this case and provide a recommendation on how the hierarchy should be correctly assigned. Consider:
1. The established structure of headline layers
2. The context of surrounding headlines  
3. The logical structure of the document

Respond with a clear recommendation and reasoning.
